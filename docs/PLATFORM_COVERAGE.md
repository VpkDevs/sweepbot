1. **Chumba Casino** — Largest user base, most community familiarity
2. **LuckyLand Slots** — Same parent company as Chumba, likely similar API structure

## How to Add a New Platform

### 1. Database
Add a row to `platforms` via migration or admin:
```sql
INSERT INTO platforms (slug, name, display_name, url, affiliate_url, status)
VALUES ('new-platform', 'New Platform', 'New Platform', 'https://newplatform.com', NULL, 'active');
```

### 2. Extension Detection
In `apps/extension/src/lib/platforms.ts`, add an entry to the platform config:
```typescript
{
  slug: 'new-platform',
  name: 'New Platform',
  displayName: 'New Platform',
  domains: ['newplatform.com', 'www.newplatform.com'],
  // XHR intercept patterns:
  apiPatterns: ['/api/game/', '/casino/spin'],
  // DOM indicators to confirm game is active:
  gameIndicators: ['.game-canvas', '#slot-container'],
}
```

### 3. Test
- [ ] Navigate to the platform's game page with extension loaded
- [ ] Confirm extension shows "active" state for this platform
- [ ] Confirm transaction capture works (check extension popup or API logs)
- [ ] No JS errors on the casino page

### 4. Update This File
- Add platform to the table above
- Set initial status
- Add a platform detail card if it's a Tier A or B target

### 5. Update AGENTS.md
If the total supported platform count changes significantly, reflect it in the AGENTS.md "What's Built" section.

## Platform Research Sources

When researching a new platform's API structure for extension development:
- Browser DevTools → Network tab while playing a game
- Look for XHR/Fetch calls during gameplay (the spin response will contain bet amount and win amount)
- Check if WebSocket is used instead (more complex to intercept)
- Community sources: r/sweepstakescasino, individual platform subreddits
